# car_price_prediction_linear_regression

This project builds machine learning models to predict car prices. We experiment with Linear Regression, and also apply Ridge and Lasso regularization to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.

## Key Steps

### Data Preprocessing

1. Handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical features (one-hot, frequency encoding)
3. Scaling numerical features (MinMax)
4. Handling outliers

### Modeling

1. Linear Regression (baseline)
2. Ridge Regression (tuned with alpha)
2. Lasso Regression (for feature selection)

### Evaluation

1. Metrics: RÂ², MAE, RMSE
2. Residual analysis
3. Comparison of coefficients across models
